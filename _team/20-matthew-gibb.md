In addition to disaster response assistance, Matt provides GIS support to the long-term Recovery programming in Haiti, Nepal, and the Philippines. His recent projects include mapping a water pipeline in rural Zimbabwe and training volunteers in a drought-affected area of Colombia. Matt oversees the creation and management of the American Red Cross' mapping projects through the Missing Maps Project and is always looking to improve how we validate the map! Prior to joining the American Red Cross, Matt was a GIS Specialist with FEMA, responding to hurricanes in the northeast and the Caribbean. He also has experience in both conservation and municipal GIS. Matt studied Geography and GIS at the University at Buffalo, and received his Master’s in GIS at Clark University. Matt enjoys traveling with the Red Cross, but loves coming home to his daughter when she asks, “Did you find all the missing maps?”
