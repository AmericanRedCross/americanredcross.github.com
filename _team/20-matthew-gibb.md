In addition to disaster response assistance, Matt provides GIS support to the Haiti and Africa programming teams at the American Red Cross. His recent projects include mapping a water pipeline in rural Zimbabwe and training volunteers in a drought-affected area of Colombia. Prior to joining the American Red Cross, Matt was a GIS Specialist with FEMA, responding to hurricanes in the northeast and the Caribbean. He also has experience in both conservation and municipal GIS. Matt studied Geography and GIS at the University at Buffalo, and received his Master’s in GIS at Clark University. Matt enjoys traveling with the Red Cross, but loves coming home to his daughter when she asks, “Did you find all the missing maps?”
