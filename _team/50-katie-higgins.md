Katie is an undergraduate senior at Texas A&M University majoring in Geographic Information Science Technology with a specific focus on Computation, Design and Analysis. Her interests include the intersections of geography, health and technology, and she hopes to find a way to synthesize them in an effort to maybe make the world a better place. As a GIS intern, Katie works on new and existing data visualization tools, utilizing her HTML/CSS/Javascript skills to do so. When she’s not thinking about GIS stuff, Katie enjoys graphic design, making websites and reading about new and interesting things so she can tell everyone she knows a new “fun fact.”
